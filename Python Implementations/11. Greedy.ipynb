    "# Activity Selection Problem | Greedy Algo-1\n",
    "Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.\n",
    "If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied. For example, Fractional Knapsack problem (See this) can be solved using Greedy, but 0-1 Knapsack cannot be solved using Greedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some standard algorithms that are Greedy algorithms.\n",
    "1) Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): In Kruskal’s algorithm, we create a MST by picking edges one by one. The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that doesn’t cause a cycle in the MST constructed so far.\n",
    "2) Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree: In Prim’s algorithm also, we create a MST by picking edges one by one. We maintain two sets: a set of the vertices already included in MST and the set of the vertices not yet included. The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that connects the two sets.\n",
    "3) Dijkstra’s Shortest Path: The Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to Prim’s algorithm. The shortest path tree is built up, edge by edge. We maintain two sets: a set of the vertices already included in the tree and the set of the vertices not yet included. The Greedy Choice is to pick the edge that connects the two sets and is on the smallest weight path from source to the set that contains not yet included vertices.\n",
    "4) Huffman Coding: Huffman Coding is a loss-less compression technique. It assigns variable-length bit codes to different characters. The Greedy Choice is to assign least bit length code to the most frequent character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy algorithms are sometimes also used to get an approximation for Hard optimization problems. For example, Traveling Salesman Problem is a NP-Hard problem. A Greedy choice for this problem is to pick the nearest unvisited city from the current city at every step. This solutions don’t always produce the best optimal solution but can be used to get an approximately optimal solution.\n",

How come the activity 1 always provides one of the optimal solutions. We can prove it by showing that if there is another solution B with the first activity other than 1, then there is also a solution A of the same size with activity 1 as the first activity. Let the first activity selected by B be k, then there always exist A = {B – {k}} U {1}.(Note that the activities in B are independent and k has smallest finishing time among all.

    "# Greedy Algorithm for Egyptian Fraction\n",

    "All jobs have the same penalty. Since all jobs have the same penalty we will do those jobs first which will take less amount of time to finish. This will minimize the total delay, and hence also the total loss incurred.\n",

    "\n",
    "We are given a sequence of N goods of production numbered from 1 to N. Each good has a volume denoted by (Vi). The constraint is that once a good has been completed its volume starts decaying at a fixed percentage (P) per day. All goods decay at the same rate and further each good take one day to complete.\n",

    "Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.\n",
    "Explanation – \n",
    "Since this is an optimization problem, we can try to solve this problem by using a greedy algorithm. On each day we make a selection from among the goods that are yet to be produced. Thus all we need is a local selection criteria or heuristic, which when applied to select the jobs will give us the optimum result.\n",

    "\n",
    "As the day increases the losses too increase. So the trick would be to ensure that the goods are not kept idle after production. Further, since we are required to produce at least one job per day, we should perform low volume jobs, and then perform the high volume jobs. This strategy works due to two factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Volume goods are not kept idle after production.\n",
    "As the volume decreases the loss per day too decreases, so for low volume goods the losses become negligible after a few days.\n",
    "So in order to obtain the optimum solution we produce the larger volume goods later on. For the first day select the good with least volume and produce it. Remove the produced good from the list of goods. For the next day repeat the same. Keep repeating while there are goods left to be produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the total volume at the end of production, keep in mind the the good produced on day i, will have  (1-P)^{N-i}  times its volume left. Evidently, the good produced on day N (last day) will have its volume intact since  (1-P)^{N-N} = 1 .\n",
